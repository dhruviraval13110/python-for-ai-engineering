# Python Syntax, Types, Operators, and Expressions — Deep Foundations

> **Course rule:** Do not memorize this chapter. Type every example, run it, deliberately break it, inspect the error, fix it, and explain the behavior in your own words.

## How to study this chapter
1. Read the mental model.
2. Type the examples instead of copy-pasting them.
3. Predict the output before running the code.
4. Run the code.
5. Change one thing and predict again.
6. Write the exercises without looking at the solution.
7. Explain the interview questions aloud.
8. Complete the mastery checklist only after you can reproduce the ideas.

## 1. Indentation and blocks

Python uses indentation to define blocks rather than braces. Consistent indentation is therefore part of syntax, not decoration. Four spaces are the common convention. Mixing tabs and spaces can produce confusing indentation errors, so editors should be configured to insert spaces.

### Mental model

Think of **Indentation and blocks** as a tool with a contract. The important question is not only what syntax exists, but what guarantee the language gives you, what assumptions your code makes, and what failure modes appear when those assumptions are wrong.

### Basic example

```python
# Predict the output before running this.
value = 10
result = value * 2
print(result)
```

### Production example

```python
def process_value(value: int) -> int:
    """Transform a value while keeping the contract explicit."""
    if not isinstance(value, int):
        raise TypeError('value must be an integer')
    return value * 2

print(process_value(10))
```

### Common mistakes
- Memorizing syntax without understanding the object or control-flow model.
- Ignoring boundary cases.
- Catching every exception and hiding the actual bug.
- Writing clever one-liners when a readable block would be easier to maintain.
- Skipping tests because the example is small.

### AI/ML connection
In AI/ML code, this concept appears in data validation, preprocessing, feature engineering, model-serving code, experiment tooling, and automation. A strong Python engineer understands the behavior of the language before relying on a library abstraction.

### Practice drills
1. Rebuild the example from memory.
2. Add an invalid input.
3. Decide what exception should be raised.
4. Write one unit test for normal input and one for a boundary or failure case.
5. Explain why your implementation is readable.

## 2. Names and naming

Names should describe purpose. A name such as customer_count communicates intent better than x. Python naming conventions use snake_case for functions and variables, PascalCase for classes, and UPPER_SNAKE_CASE for constants by convention.

### Mental model

Think of **Names and naming** as a tool with a contract. The important question is not only what syntax exists, but what guarantee the language gives you, what assumptions your code makes, and what failure modes appear when those assumptions are wrong.

### Basic example

```python
# Predict the output before running this.
value = 10
result = value * 2
print(result)
```

### Production example

```python
def process_value(value: int) -> int:
    """Transform a value while keeping the contract explicit."""
    if not isinstance(value, int):
        raise TypeError('value must be an integer')
    return value * 2

print(process_value(10))
```

## 3. Numbers

Python provides integers, floating-point numbers, and complex numbers as built-in numeric types. Integers have arbitrary precision in normal Python implementations, while floats follow the platform floating-point representation and can contain rounding error.

### Mental model

Think of **Numbers** as a tool with a contract. The important question is not only what syntax exists, but what guarantee the language gives you, what assumptions your code makes, and what failure modes appear when those assumptions are wrong.

### Basic example

```python
# Predict the output before running this.
value = 10
result = value * 2
print(result)
```

### Production example

```python
def process_value(value: int) -> int:
    """Transform a value while keeping the contract explicit."""
    if not isinstance(value, int):
        raise TypeError('value must be an integer')
    return value * 2

## 4. Booleans and truthiness

True and False are boolean values. Python also defines truth-value testing for many other objects. Empty containers, zero numeric values, None, and False are falsy; most other objects are truthy. Truthiness is convenient but should not be confused with equality to True.

### Mental model

Think of **Booleans and truthiness** as a tool with a contract. The important question is not only what syntax exists, but what guarantee the language gives you, what assumptions your code makes, and what failure modes appear when those assumptions are wrong.

### Basic example

```python
# Predict the output before running this.
value = 10
result = value * 2
print(result)
```

### Production example

```python
def process_value(value: int) -> int:
    """Transform a value while keeping the contract explicit."""
    if not isinstance(value, int):
        raise TypeError('value must be an integer')
    return value * 2

print(process_value(10))
```

## 5. Strings

Strings are immutable Unicode sequences. Indexing retrieves one-character strings, slicing creates substrings, and methods such as split, join, strip, replace, and case conversion support text processing. f-strings are usually the clearest way to build formatted text.

### Mental model

Think of **Strings** as a tool with a contract. The important question is not only what syntax exists, but what guarantee the language gives you, what assumptions your code makes, and what failure modes appear when those assumptions are wrong.

### Basic example

```python
# Predict the output before running this.
value = 10
result = value * 2
print(result)
```

### Production example

```python
def process_value(value: int) -> int:
    """Transform a value while keeping the contract explicit."""
    if not isinstance(value, int):
        raise TypeError('value must be an integer')
    return value * 2

print(process_value(10))
```

### Common mistakes

## 6. Operators

Python includes arithmetic, comparison, boolean, bitwise, membership, identity, assignment, and augmented assignment operators. Operator precedence determines grouping, but parentheses should be used when they improve readability.

### Mental model

Think of **Operators** as a tool with a contract. The important question is not only what syntax exists, but what guarantee the language gives you, what assumptions your code makes, and what failure modes appear when those assumptions are wrong.

### Basic example

value = 10
result = value * 2
print(result)
```

### Production example

```python
def process_value(value: int) -> int:
    """Transform a value while keeping the contract explicit."""
    if not isinstance(value, int):
        raise TypeError('value must be an integer')
    return value * 2

## 7. Conversions

Type conversion can be explicit through constructors such as int, float, str, list, tuple, set, and dict. Conversion can fail, lose information, or create a new object, so conversion should be deliberate rather than automatic in your mental model.

### Mental model

Think of **Conversions** as a tool with a contract. The important question is not only what syntax exists, but what guarantee the language gives you, what assumptions your code makes, and what failure modes appear when those assumptions are wrong.

### Basic example

```python
# Predict the output before running this.
value = 10
result = value * 2
print(result)
```

### Production example

```python
def process_value(value: int) -> int:
    """Transform a value while keeping the contract explicit."""
    if not isinstance(value, int):
        raise TypeError('value must be an integer')
    return value * 2

print(process_value(10))
```

### Common mistakes

## 8. Slicing

The slice form sequence[start:stop:step] uses a start index inclusive and stop index exclusive. Negative indexes count from the end. A negative step reverses traversal. Slicing is powerful, but it normally creates a new sequence rather than a view for built-in lists and strings.

### Mental model

Think of **Slicing** as a tool with a contract. The important question is not only what syntax exists, but what guarantee the language gives you, what assumptions your code makes, and what failure modes appear when those assumptions are wrong.

### Basic example

```python
# Predict the output before running this.
value = 10
result = value * 2
print(result)
```

### Production example

```python
def process_value(value: int) -> int:
    """Transform a value while keeping the contract explicit."""
    if not isinstance(value, int):
        raise TypeError('value must be an integer')
    return value * 2

## 9. Comprehensions

List, set, and dictionary comprehensions provide compact ways to construct collections. They are excellent when the transformation is simple. If a comprehension becomes difficult to read or contains multiple layers of business logic, use a normal loop or helper function.

### Mental model

Think of **Comprehensions** as a tool with a contract. The important question is not only what syntax exists, but what guarantee the language gives you, what assumptions your code makes, and what failure modes appear when those assumptions are wrong.

### Basic example

value = 10
result = value * 2
print(result)
```

### Production example

```python
def process_value(value: int) -> int:
    """Transform a value while keeping the contract explicit."""
    if not isinstance(value, int):
        raise TypeError('value must be an integer')
    return value * 2

print(process_value(10))
```

### Common mistakes

value = 10
result = value * 2
print(result)
```

### Production example

```python
def process_value(value: int) -> int:
    """Transform a value while keeping the contract explicit."""

5. Explain why your implementation is readable.

### Interview questions for this topic

**Q:** What is Pattern matching and why does Python provide it?

**Answer framework:** Define it precisely → show a minimal example → explain the runtime/data model → discuss trade-offs → give a production example → mention a failure mode.

**Q:** When would you use Pattern matching in production?

**Answer framework:** Define it precisely → show a minimal example → explain the runtime/data model → discuss trade-offs → give a production example → mention a failure mode.

**Q:** What is a common mistake involving Pattern matching?

**Answer framework:** Define it precisely → show a minimal example → explain the runtime/data model → discuss trade-offs → give a production example → mention a failure mode.

**Q:** What happens internally or conceptually when Pattern matching is used?

**Answer framework:** Define it precisely → show a minimal example → explain the runtime/data model → discuss trade-offs → give a production example → mention a failure mode.

**Q:** How would you test code involving Pattern matching?

**Answer framework:** Define it precisely → show a minimal example → explain the runtime/data model → discuss trade-offs → give a production example → mention a failure mode.

**Q:** How could Pattern matching appear in an AI/ML project?

**Answer framework:** Define it precisely → show a minimal example → explain the runtime/data model → discuss trade-offs → give a production example → mention a failure mode.

# Final Foundation Review

## Build challenge
Create a CLI application that accepts user input, validates it, stores structured records, performs calculations, persists data to a file, handles expected errors, logs important events, and has unit tests. Do not use external frameworks. After completing it, refactor repeated logic into functions and then into a small package.

## Oral interview drill
Explain the following without notes: names versus objects; equality versus identity; mutability; scope; iteration; exception boundaries; context managers; modules versus packages; virtual environments; classes versus instances; composition versus inheritance; shallow versus deep copying; iterables versus iterators; generators; decorators; type hints; testing strategy; and why clean boundaries matter in AI/ML systems.

## Graduation standard
You are ready to move forward when you can build a small Python program from an empty directory, explain every important design decision, write tests for its behavior, diagnose failures from tracebacks, and explain why your solution is preferable to at least one plausible alternative.
