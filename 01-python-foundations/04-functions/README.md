# Functions — From First Function to Production-Quality APIs

> **Course rule:** Do not memorize this chapter. Type every example, run it, deliberately break it, inspect the error, fix it, and explain the behavior in your own words.

## How to study this chapter
1. Read the mental model.
2. Type the examples instead of copy-pasting them.
3. Predict the output before running the code.
4. Run the code.
5. Change one thing and predict again.
6. Write the exercises without looking at the solution.
7. Explain the interview questions aloud.
8. Complete the mastery checklist only after you can reproduce the ideas.

## 1. Why functions matter

Functions package behavior behind a reusable interface. In production, good functions reduce duplication, isolate changes, make testing easier, and provide meaningful boundaries between parts of a system.

### Mental model

Think of **Why functions matter** as a tool with a contract. The important question is not only what syntax exists, but what guarantee the language gives you, what assumptions your code makes, and what failure modes appear when those assumptions are wrong.

### Basic example

```python
# Predict the output before running this.
value = 10
result = value * 2
print(result)
```

### Production example

```python
def process_value(value: int) -> int:
    """Transform a value while keeping the contract explicit."""
    if not isinstance(value, int):
        raise TypeError('value must be an integer')
    return value * 2

print(process_value(10))
```

### Common mistakes
- Memorizing syntax without understanding the object or control-flow model.
- Ignoring boundary cases.
- Catching every exception and hiding the actual bug.
- Writing clever one-liners when a readable block would be easier to maintain.
- Skipping tests because the example is small.

### AI/ML connection
In AI/ML code, this concept appears in data validation, preprocessing, feature engineering, model-serving code, experiment tooling, and automation. A strong Python engineer understands the behavior of the language before relying on a library abstraction.

### Practice drills
1. Rebuild the example from memory.
2. Add an invalid input.
3. Decide what exception should be raised.
4. Write one unit test for normal input and one for a boundary or failure case.
5. Explain why your implementation is readable.

## 2. Parameters and arguments

Parameters are names in the function definition; arguments are values supplied at the call site. Python supports positional arguments, keyword arguments, defaults, positional-only parameters, and keyword-only parameters.

### Mental model

Think of **Parameters and arguments** as a tool with a contract. The important question is not only what syntax exists, but what guarantee the language gives you, what assumptions your code makes, and what failure modes appear when those assumptions are wrong.

### Basic example

```python
# Predict the output before running this.
value = 10
result = value * 2
print(result)
```

### Production example

```python
def process_value(value: int) -> int:
    """Transform a value while keeping the contract explicit."""
    if not isinstance(value, int):
        raise TypeError('value must be an integer')
    return value * 2

print(process_value(10))
```

## 3. Return values

return sends a value back to the caller. A function without an explicit return returns None. Returning useful values is generally preferable to hiding important state in global variables.

### Mental model

Think of **Return values** as a tool with a contract. The important question is not only what syntax exists, but what guarantee the language gives you, what assumptions your code makes, and what failure modes appear when those assumptions are wrong.

### Basic example

```python
# Predict the output before running this.
value = 10
result = value * 2
print(result)
```

### Production example

```python
def process_value(value: int) -> int:
    """Transform a value while keeping the contract explicit."""
    if not isinstance(value, int):
        raise TypeError('value must be an integer')
    return value * 2

print(process_value(10))
```

## 4. Scope

Python resolves names through a scope system commonly summarized as LEGB: Local, Enclosing, Global, Builtins. Understanding lookup prevents accidental global dependencies and explains closures.

### Mental model

Think of **Scope** as a tool with a contract. The important question is not only what syntax exists, but what guarantee the language gives you, what assumptions your code makes, and what failure modes appear when those assumptions are wrong.

value = 10
result = value * 2
print(result)
```

### Production example

```python
def process_value(value: int) -> int:
    """Transform a value while keeping the contract explicit."""
    if not isinstance(value, int):
        raise TypeError('value must be an integer')
    return value * 2

## 5. Default arguments

Default argument expressions are evaluated once when the function is defined. This is why a mutable default such as [] can retain state between calls. Use None or another immutable sentinel and create the mutable object inside the function.

### Mental model

Think of **Default arguments** as a tool with a contract. The important question is not only what syntax exists, but what guarantee the language gives you, what assumptions your code makes, and what failure modes appear when those assumptions are wrong.

### Basic example

```python
# Predict the output before running this.
value = 10
result = value * 2
print(result)
```

### Production example

```python
def process_value(value: int) -> int:
    """Transform a value while keeping the contract explicit."""
    if not isinstance(value, int):
        raise TypeError('value must be an integer')
    return value * 2

print(process_value(10))
```

## 6. *args and **kwargs

*args captures extra positional arguments as a tuple; **kwargs captures extra keyword arguments as a dictionary. They are useful for flexible wrappers and APIs, but explicit parameters are usually better when the interface is known.

### Mental model

Think of ***args and **kwargs** as a tool with a contract. The important question is not only what syntax exists, but what guarantee the language gives you, what assumptions your code makes, and what failure modes appear when those assumptions are wrong.

value = 10
result = value * 2
print(result)
```

### Production example

```python
def process_value(value: int) -> int:
    """Transform a value while keeping the contract explicit."""

value = 10
result = value * 2
print(result)
```

### Production example

```python
def process_value(value: int) -> int:
    """Transform a value while keeping the contract explicit."""
    if not isinstance(value, int):
        raise TypeError('value must be an integer')
    return value * 2

print(process_value(10))
```

## 8. Docstrings

Docstrings explain the public contract of a function: purpose, parameters, return value, exceptions, side effects, and important assumptions. They should describe behavior, not narrate every line of implementation.

### Mental model

Think of **Docstrings** as a tool with a contract. The important question is not only what syntax exists, but what guarantee the language gives you, what assumptions your code makes, and what failure modes appear when those assumptions are wrong.

print(result)
```

### Production example

```python
def process_value(value: int) -> int:
    """Transform a value while keeping the contract explicit."""
    if not isinstance(value, int):

## 11. Closures

A closure is a function that retains access to variables from an enclosing scope. Closures are useful for factories and decorators, but they should be used where the retained state makes the abstraction clearer.

### Mental model

Think of **Closures** as a tool with a contract. The important question is not only what syntax exists, but what guarantee the language gives you, what assumptions your code makes, and what failure modes appear when those assumptions are wrong.

### Basic example

```python
# Predict the output before running this.
value = 10
result = value * 2
print(result)
```

### Production example

```python
def process_value(value: int) -> int:
    """Transform a value while keeping the contract explicit."""
    if not isinstance(value, int):
        raise TypeError('value must be an integer')
    return value * 2

print(process_value(10))
```

### Common mistakes
- Memorizing syntax without understanding the object or control-flow model.
- Ignoring boundary cases.
- Catching every exception and hiding the actual bug.
- Writing clever one-liners when a readable block would be easier to maintain.
- Skipping tests because the example is small.

### AI/ML connection
In AI/ML code, this concept appears in data validation, preprocessing, feature engineering, model-serving code, experiment tooling, and automation. A strong Python engineer understands the behavior of the language before relying on a library abstraction.

### Practice drills
1. Rebuild the example from memory.
2. Add an invalid input.
3. Decide what exception should be raised.
4. Write one unit test for normal input and one for a boundary or failure case.
5. Explain why your implementation is readable.

## 12. Decorators

A decorator receives a callable and returns a callable, often wrapping behavior such as logging, authorization, timing, caching, or retries. functools.wraps should normally be used to preserve metadata.

### Mental model

Think of **Decorators** as a tool with a contract. The important question is not only what syntax exists, but what guarantee the language gives you, what assumptions your code makes, and what failure modes appear when those assumptions are wrong.

### Basic example

```python
# Predict the output before running this.
value = 10
result = value * 2
print(result)
```

### Production example

```python
def process_value(value: int) -> int:
    """Transform a value while keeping the contract explicit."""
    if not isinstance(value, int):
        raise TypeError('value must be an integer')
    return value * 2

print(process_value(10))
```

## 13. Testing functions

A function should be tested around its contract: normal inputs, boundary values, invalid inputs, and important failure modes. Small deterministic functions are ideal unit-test targets.

### Mental model

Think of **Testing functions** as a tool with a contract. The important question is not only what syntax exists, but what guarantee the language gives you, what assumptions your code makes, and what failure modes appear when those assumptions are wrong.

### Basic example

```python
# Predict the output before running this.
value = 10
result = value * 2
print(result)
```

### Production example

```python
def process_value(value: int) -> int:
    """Transform a value while keeping the contract explicit."""
    if not isinstance(value, int):
        raise TypeError('value must be an integer')
    return value * 2

print(process_value(10))
```

# Final Foundation Review

## Build challenge
Create a CLI application that accepts user input, validates it, stores structured records, performs calculations, persists data to a file, handles expected errors, logs important events, and has unit tests. Do not use external frameworks. After completing it, refactor repeated logic into functions and then into a small package.

## Oral interview drill
Explain the following without notes: names versus objects; equality versus identity; mutability; scope; iteration; exception boundaries; context managers; modules versus packages; virtual environments; classes versus instances; composition versus inheritance; shallow versus deep copying; iterables versus iterators; generators; decorators; type hints; testing strategy; and why clean boundaries matter in AI/ML systems.

## Graduation standard
You are ready to move forward when you can build a small Python program from an empty directory, explain every important design decision, write tests for its behavior, diagnose failures from tracebacks, and explain why your solution is preferable to at least one plausible alternative.
